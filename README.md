# Smart Bridge Using Arduino with Auto Height Increase

A smart automated bridge prototype that detects flood conditions and automatically elevates its height to prevent damage.  
This project demonstrates how **embedded systems, sensors, and automation** can be used for **disaster-resilient infrastructure**.

---

## Project Overview

During floods, many bridges collapse due to sudden water level rise.  
This project presents a **miniature smart bridge system** that:

- Detects rising water levels
- Automatically lifts the bridge using a servo motor
- Displays real-time status on an OLED screen
- Alerts users through visual indicators

The system is built using **Arduino Uno** and low-cost components, making it suitable for educational, exhibition, and prototype purposes.

##  Objectives

- Detect flood or water presence in real time
- Automatically elevate the bridge structure
- Provide visual alerts and status updates
- Demonstrate automation in smart infrastructure systems

---

## Working Principle

1. A **soil moisture sensor** detects the presence of water.
2. Arduino processes the sensor input.
3. If water is detected:
   - The **servo motor rotates**, lifting the bridge.
4. If no water is detected:
   - Bridge remains in normal position.
   - OLED shows "Safe Level".

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- USB Programming Cable
- No external libraries required (default Arduino libraries used)

---

##to Run the Project

1. Assemble the circuit as per the diagram.
2. Upload the code to Arduino Uno.
3. Power the system using battery or USB.
4. Place the soil moisture sensor near water.
5. Observe automatic bridge elevation and alerts.

## Testing

- Dry sensor → Bridge remains down (Safe mode)
- Sensor dipped in water → Bridge lifts automatically
- Servo angle and delay can be adjusted in code
